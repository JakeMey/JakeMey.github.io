The repository at https://jakemey.github.io/ contains the game "Cthulhu", a thrilling space shooter where players defend Earth from an invasion by Cthulhu's minions.

The game was created using the open source game engine GDevelop and hosted utilising web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The gameplay features controls for movement (A and D keys), shooting (Spacebar), and activating a shield (Enter key). Players confront the terrifying Cthulhu while uncovering the mysteries of the cosmos.

The design and structure have been guided by a feature design document implemented during development to outline the game feature's functionality and user experience.
